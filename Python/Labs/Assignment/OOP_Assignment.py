# A mystery adventure game where the user must solve a puzzle on each level to gather the clue for that level
# The clues are used to solve the final puzzle and win the game
# The game is played in the terminal and the user must input their choices
# This project is a demonstration of object oriented programming and the use of object oriented concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism
# The project also demonstrates the use of classes, objects, and methods in Python
